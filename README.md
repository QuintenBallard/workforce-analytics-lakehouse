# Workforce Analytics Lakehouse

This project builds a Workforce Analytics Lakehouse using Databricks Free Edition, Unity Catalog, Databricks-managed storage, Python, and Delta Lake.

The **Bronze and Silver layers are implemented**. Bronze preserves the raw source files, while Silver uses PySpark to clean, validate, standardize, deduplicate, and store the data as managed Delta tables.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to collect workforce analytics data from public labor market sources and transform it into reliable, analytics-ready datasets for occupation, wage, employment, growth, education, skill, and technology analysis.

The project uses:

* Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)
* O*NET downloadable database
* Databricks Free Edition
* Unity Catalog
* Managed Unity Catalog Volumes
* Python ingestion scripts
* GitHub version control

This project does **not** use AWS S3 directly. Databricks-managed storage is used through Unity Catalog.

---

# Architecture

The project follows a medallion architecture:

```text
Bronze  → Raw source files
Silver  → Cleaned, validated, structured tables
Gold    → Analytics-ready dashboard tables
```

The **Bronze and Silver layers have been implemented**. The next stage is the Gold layer, where BLS and O*NET tables will be joined through standardized SOC occupation codes to support dashboards and workforce analytics.

The Bronze layer stores:

* Raw BLS API JSON files
* Raw O*NET text database files
* Raw O*NET ZIP archive
* Manifest files documenting what was downloaded

No cleaning, validation, deduplication, casting, or transformation is performed in the Bronze layer.

# Databricks Storage Setup

This project uses a Unity Catalog managed volume for raw Bronze files.

## Create the Catalog, Schemas, and Volume

Run this SQL in Databricks:

```sql
CREATE CATALOG IF NOT EXISTS workforce_analytics;

CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS workforce_analytics.bronze;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS workforce_analytics.silver;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS workforce_analytics.gold;

CREATE VOLUME IF NOT EXISTS workforce_analytics.bronze.raw_files;
```

This creates the managed Bronze volume:

```text
/Volumes/workforce_analytics/bronze/raw_files/
```

This volume is used to store raw JSON, ZIP, and tab-delimited text files.

# Bronze Layer Design

The Bronze layer is responsible for raw ingestion only.

## Bronze Rules

The Bronze layer should:

* Store source files exactly as collected
* Preserve raw JSON and text file formats
* Keep the original O*NET ZIP archive
* Store files in meaningful folders
* Create manifest files for traceability
* Avoid cleaning, validation, casting, or transformation

The Bronze layer should **not**:

* Rename columns
* Cast data types
* Remove duplicates
* Filter bad records
* Flatten nested JSON
* Convert raw files into Delta tables
* Apply business logic

Those steps belong in the Silver layer.

---

# Bronze Storage Paths

The raw files are stored in this Unity Catalog managed volume:

```text
/Volumes/workforce_analytics/bronze/raw_files/
```

The expected folder structure is:

```text
/Volumes/workforce_analytics/bronze/raw_files/

# Data Sources

## 1. Bureau of Labor Statistics API

The BLS API is used to collect labor market time-series data.

Base API URL:

```text
https://api.bls.gov/publicAPI/v2/timeseries/data/
```

The current Bronze ingestion pulls the latest available value for selected BLS series.

The BLS ingestion script saves one raw JSON file per series.

## 2. O*NET Database Text Download

The O*NET downloadable database is used for occupation, skill, education, and work requirement data.

Source ZIP file:

```text
https://www.onetcenter.org/dl_files/database/db_30_3_text.zip
```

The O*NET text download contains tab-delimited `.txt` files, not comma-separated CSV files.

The Bronze ingestion script downloads the ZIP file, stores the raw ZIP archive, extracts the `.txt` files, and saves them into the Bronze managed volume.

---

# BLS Data Collected

The BLS Bronze ingestion collects 16 total series.

## JOLTS National Labor Demand and Turnover

These series come from JOLTS, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey.

| File Name                              | Series ID               | Description                           |

# O*NET Data Collected

The O*NET Bronze ingestion downloads the full O*NET database text ZIP file.

The raw ZIP file is saved here:

```text
/Volumes/workforce_analytics/bronze/raw_files/onet/raw_zip/onet_database_30_3_text.zip
```

The extracted text files are saved here:

```text
/Volumes/workforce_analytics/bronze/raw_files/onet/text_files/
```

Important O*NET files for later Silver processing include:

| File                                      | Purpose                                           |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `Occupation Data.txt`                     | Occupation titles and SOC codes                   |
| `Education Categories.txt`                | Education level category mappings                 |
| `Education, Training, and Experience.txt` | Education, training, and experience requirements  |
| `Knowledge.txt`                           | Knowledge areas by occupation                     |
| `Abilities.txt`                           | Worker abilities by occupation                    |
| `Skills.txt` or related skills files      | Skills by occupation, depending on O*NET version  |
| `Technology Skills.txt`                   | Tools and technologies linked to occupations      |
| `Task Statements.txt`                     | Job task descriptions                             |
| `Work Activities.txt`                     | Work activity data                                |
| `Job Zones.txt`                           | Job preparation level and experience requirements |

O*NET files are tab-delimited text files. In Silver, they should be read with a tab separator:

```python
.option("sep", "\t")
```

# Silver Layer Implementation

The Silver layer transforms the raw Bronze files into clean, structured, and reusable Delta tables under:

```text
workforce_analytics.silver
```

The Silver pipeline is implemented with PySpark and is organized into four main modules:

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `data/silver/utils.py` | Shared file readers, cleaning functions, SOC normalization, safe type casting, validation, deduplication, issue creation, and Delta writers |
| `data/silver/bls_tables.py` | Builds the BLS OEWS, Employment Projections, National Employment Matrix, and occupation crosswalk tables |
| `data/silver/onet_tables.py` | Builds O*NET occupation, education, skill, knowledge, ability, task, activity, technology, and job-zone tables |
| `data/silver/data_insertion.py` | Orchestrates the pipeline, writes managed Delta tables, and records processing audit information |

## Silver Data Sources

The Silver layer currently processes the following occupation-level sources:

* BLS Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS)
* BLS Employment Projections
* BLS National Employment Matrix
* BLS O*NET-SOC and NEM crosswalk files
* O*NET occupation and workforce requirement text files

The BLS and O*NET datasets are standardized around SOC occupation codes so they can be joined later in the Gold layer.

## Data Cleaning

Reusable cleaning functions are applied consistently across BLS and O*NET datasets.

### Column Standardization

Source headers are converted to lowercase `snake_case`.

Examples:

```text
O*NET-SOC Code   → onet_soc_code
Data Value       → data_value
Employment, 2024 → employment_2024
```

The pipeline also checks for column-name collisions after normalization so two different source fields cannot silently become the same Silver column.

### String Cleaning

All string columns are trimmed to remove leading and trailing whitespace. This prevents visually identical values from being treated as different records because of hidden spaces.

### Missing-Value Standardization

Source placeholders such as the following are converted to actual Spark null values:

```text
""
-
—
N/A
NA
null
```

Missing values are not automatically replaced with zero because zero may be a valid workforce metric.

### Safe Type Casting

Source files are initially loaded as strings. Numeric fields are then converted to appropriate Spark types such as:

```text
int
double
boolean
```

The pipeline uses SQL `try_cast` rather than strict casting. Invalid values become null and are written to the centralized data-quality table instead of stopping the entire pipeline.

Currency symbols, commas, and percentage symbols are removed before numeric conversion when appropriate.

### BLS Wage Qualifiers

BLS may publish top-coded wage values such as:

```text
>=$239200
```

The Silver pipeline preserves both the numeric value and its meaning:

```text
median_annual_wage_raw       = >=$239200
median_annual_wage           = 239200.0
median_annual_wage_qualifier = greater_than_or_equal
```

This prevents the wage ceiling from being discarded as malformed data.

### Boolean Standardization

O*NET yes/no fields are converted to Boolean values.

Examples:

```text
Y, Yes, True, 1  → true
N, No, False, 0  → false
```

## SOC Code Normalization

SOC codes are the shared occupation key used to connect BLS and O*NET data.

The Silver pipeline standardizes BLS and O*NET occupation codes into:

```text
soc_code      = ##-####
onet_soc_code = ##-####.##
```

Examples:

```text
151252     → 15-1252
15-1252.00 → 15-1252
15-1252.01 → onet_soc_code 15-1252.01 and soc_code 15-1252
```

The detailed O*NET extension is preserved while the base SOC code is also created for cross-source joins.

## Data Validation

Validation is performed before records are written to the final Silver tables.

The pipeline checks for:

* Missing required source columns
* Null values in required fields
* Invalid SOC and O*NET-SOC formats
* Invalid BLS period codes
* Failed numeric and Boolean conversions
* Exact duplicate business keys
* Conflicting records that share the same business key

Invalid required records are excluded from clean Silver tables after their issues have been captured.

## Deduplication

Each dataset defines a business key appropriate to its grain.

Examples include:

```text
OEWS observation:
series_id + year + period

O*NET rating:
onet_soc_code + element_id + scale_id

Occupation lookup:
occupation_code
```

The deduplication process:

1. Creates a SHA-256 hash from the row values.
2. Groups records by the dataset business key.
3. Identifies exact duplicates and conflicting duplicates.
4. Retains one deterministic record per business key.
5. Writes duplicate details to the data-quality issue table.

Exact duplicates are recorded as warnings. Conflicting duplicates are recorded as errors.

## Data Concatenation

The Silver pipeline uses schema-aware row concatenation where multiple DataFrames represent the same logical structure.

All dataset-specific validation results are concatenated with:

```python
unionByName()
```

This creates one centralized data-quality issue dataset while preserving a consistent schema.

The pipeline does not combine unrelated source tables into one oversized table. BLS and O*NET datasets remain source-aligned in Silver and will be joined through SOC codes in Gold.

## Data Lineage and Audit Columns

Every Silver record includes metadata that supports traceability:

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `source_file_path` | Bronze file from which the record originated |
| `run_id` | Unique identifier for the pipeline execution |
| `processed_at` | Timestamp when the record was processed |

The pipeline also maintains:

```text
workforce_analytics.silver.data_quality_issues
workforce_analytics.silver.processing_audit
```

The audit table records table-level processing status, row counts, write mode, start time, completion time, and error details.

## Managed Delta Tables

The cleaned DataFrames are written as managed Unity Catalog Delta tables.

### BLS Silver Tables

```text
bls_oews_observations
bls_oews_series
bls_oews_occupations
bls_oews_areas
bls_oews_industries
bls_oews_datatypes
bls_oews_footnotes
bls_employment_projections
bls_national_employment_matrix
bls_onet_soc_crosswalk
bls_nem_occupational_coverage
```

### O*NET Silver Tables

```text
onet_occupations
onet_education_categories
onet_education
onet_training_experience
onet_essential_skills
onet_transferable_skills
onet_software_skills
onet_knowledge
onet_abilities
onet_task_statements
onet_work_activities
onet_job_zones
onet_related_occupations
```

### Quality and Audit Tables

```text
data_quality_issues
processing_audit
```

## Databricks Serverless Compatibility

The Silver pipeline runs on Databricks Serverless compute.

Because DataFrame `persist()`, `cache()`, and `unpersist()` operations are not supported in this environment, the pipeline writes DataFrames directly to Delta tables and reads completed tables for final row counts.

Excel workbooks are opened with Pandas and `openpyxl`, then immediately converted to Spark DataFrames for distributed transformation and validation.

## Running the Silver Pipeline

Install the Excel dependency in the Databricks job environment:

```text
openpyxl
```

Run:

```text
data/silver/data_insertion.py
```

The pipeline performs the following steps:

1. Creates the Silver schema if it does not exist.
2. Reads BLS Bronze text and Excel files.
3. Cleans, standardizes, validates, casts, and deduplicates BLS records.
4. Writes the BLS managed Delta tables.
5. Reads and transforms O*NET tab-delimited files.
6. Writes the O*NET managed Delta tables.
7. Concatenates all validation results.
8. Writes the data-quality and processing-audit tables.

## Verifying the Silver Layer

List the created tables:

```sql
SHOW TABLES IN workforce_analytics.silver;
```

Query a fully qualified table:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM workforce_analytics.silver.onet_education;
```

Review pipeline results:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM workforce_analytics.silver.processing_audit
ORDER BY completed_at DESC;
```

Review validation issues:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM workforce_analytics.silver.data_quality_issues
ORDER BY detected_at DESC;
```

# Dependencies

## Bronze Dependencies

The Bronze ingestion scripts use standard Python libraries for HTTP requests, JSON processing, ZIP extraction, file operations, and timestamps.

## Silver Dependencies

The Silver transformation pipeline uses:

```text
pyspark
pandas
openpyxl
```

`openpyxl` is required to read the BLS Excel workbooks. In Databricks Serverless jobs, it should be added to the task environment or included in `requirements.txt`.

Example:

```text
openpyxl
```

PySpark is provided by Databricks and is used for cleaning, validation, deduplication, schema enforcement, and Delta table writes.

---

# Running the Bronze Ingestion

The ingestion scripts should be run inside Databricks so they can write to the Unity Catalog managed volume.

## Recommended Workflow

1. Open the Databricks workspace.
2. Open the connected Git folder for this repository.
3. Confirm the Unity Catalog objects exist.
4. Run the setup SQL if needed.
5. Run the Bronze ingestion scripts.

## Step 1: Create Unity Catalog Objects

Run:

```sql
CREATE CATALOG IF NOT EXISTS workforce_analytics;

CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS workforce_analytics.bronze;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS workforce_analytics.silver;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS workforce_analytics.gold;

CREATE VOLUME IF NOT EXISTS workforce_analytics.bronze.raw_files;
```

## Step 2: Run BLS Ingestion

Run:

```text
src/bronze/ingest_bls_api.py
```

Expected result:

```text
BLS raw JSON files saved to Bronze volume.
Manifest saved to: /Volumes/workforce_analytics/bronze/raw_files/bls/api/_manifest.json
```

## Step 3: Run O*NET Ingestion

Run:

```text
src/bronze/ingest_onet_text.py
```

Expected result:

```text
O*NET raw files saved to Bronze volume.
Manifest saved to: /Volumes/workforce_analytics/bronze/raw_files/onet/_manifest.json
```

---

# How to Verify Bronze Files

After running the scripts, check the files in Databricks Catalog Explorer.

Navigate to:

```text
Catalog → workforce_analytics → bronze → Volumes → raw_files
```

Expected folders:

```text
bls/
onet/
```

You can also check files with Python:

```python
import os

base_path = "/Volumes/workforce_analytics/bronze/raw_files"

for root, dirs, files in os.walk(base_path):
    for file in files:
        print(os.path.join(root, file))
```

Expected Bronze outputs:

* 16 BLS raw JSON files
* 1 BLS manifest file
* 1 O*NET raw ZIP file
* Multiple O*NET tab-delimited text files
* 1 O*NET manifest file

---

# Important Notes

## Bronze Does Not Use PySpark

The Bronze layer only downloads and stores raw files.

PySpark is not needed at this stage because no distributed transformations are performed.

PySpark is used in the Silver layer to:

* Read raw JSON and text files
* Flatten nested BLS JSON
* Parse O*NET tab-delimited files
* Validate records
* Cast data types
* Write Delta tables

## Bronze Does Not Clean Data

The Bronze layer intentionally preserves the raw source data.

Cleaning and validation are delayed until the Silver layer so that the original source files remain available for auditing and reprocessing.

## BLS API Warnings

Some BLS API responses may include warning messages about missing catalog metadata. These warnings do not necessarily mean the API request failed.

If the response contains data and the status is `REQUEST_SUCCEEDED`, the raw response is still saved in Bronze.

Detailed validation of these responses is handled in the Silver layer.

---

# Next Stage: Gold Layer

The next stage will create analytics-ready Gold tables that join BLS and O*NET data through standardized SOC occupation codes.

Planned Gold outputs include:

* Occupation wage and employment profiles
* Fastest-growing and declining occupations
* Highest-paying occupations by education level
* Occupation skills and technology profiles
* Education and training requirements by occupation
* Annual openings and projected-growth analysis
* Workforce shortage indicators
* Power BI or Tableau dashboard tables

Gold tables will be stored under:

```text
workforce_analytics.gold
```
